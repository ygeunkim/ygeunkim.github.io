In the sample from 2005 to 2006, for example, the chosen model might forecast well. Imagine, however, we should include 2007 to 2008 period in which financial crisis occurred. The estimators of the model would change due to this eventüò≠. It is important to figure out these change points because the model parameter could change at the point. The goal of change point analysis is to mark the timestamp when some parameter has changed. Here the simplest setting is to detect change of the mean \\(\\mu_t\\) in location model.\n$$Y_t = \\mu_t + \\epsilon_t, \\quad t = 1, \\ldots, n$$\nThen change point detection can be expressed by\n$$H_0: \\mu_1 = \\cdots = \\mu_n \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_1: \\exists k \\colon \\mu_1 = \\cdots = \\mu_k \\neq \\mu_{k + 1} = \\cdots = \\mu_n$$\nNow, each method should\nEstimate unknown \\(k\\). Test. Single Change Point First consider single change point problem with \\(k = 100\\).\ny1 \u0026lt;- tibble(key = \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;, value = rnorm(100, mean = 0), mean = 0) y2 \u0026lt;- tibble(key = \u0026#34;b\u0026#34;, value = rnorm(150, mean = 5), mean = 5) # bind rows and bind time index column---------------- sim_single \u0026lt;- bind_rows(y1, y2) %\u0026gt;% mutate(index = 1:n()) LSE CUSUM (PAGE 1954) These 2 methods can find one change point.\nLSE Change Point Detection Above figure just changes time plot to point. To estimate \\(k\\), the most easiest way is to minimize sum of within sums of square.\nLet\n\\(\\overline{Y}_k = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{t = 1}^k Y_t\\) and let \\(\\overline{Y}_k^\\ast = \\frac{1}{n - k} \\sum_{t = k + 1}^n Y_t\\). Then\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{k}^{LS} \u0026amp; = \\arg\\min_{1 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\left( \\sum_{t = 1}^k (Y_t - \\overline{Y}_k)^2 + \\sum_{t = k + 1}^n (Y_t - \\overline{Y}_k^\\ast)^2 \\right) \\\\ \u0026amp; = \\arg\\max_{1 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\sqrt{\\frac{k (n - k)}{n}} \\left\\lvert \\overline{Y}_k - \\overline{Y}_k^\\ast \\right\\rvert \\end{aligned}$$\nObserve that by multiplying \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{k (n - k)}{n}}\\), it adjusts the location of \\(k\\) and the sample size. You can see this feature in the following figure.\nlse_output \u0026lt;- sim_single %\u0026gt;% mutate( mean_k = cumsum(value) / index, mean_ast = sapply( index + 1, function(i) { sum(value[i:n()]) } ) / (n() - index), lse_unadjust = abs(mean_k - mean_ast), lse_adjust = sqrt(index * (n() - index) / n()) * lse_unadjust ) While LSE estimator performs well, unadjusted LSE inflates against \\(k\\).\nCumulative Sum (CUSUM) Estimator This method is called CUSUM because it deals with cumulative sum (of \\(Y_t - \\overline{Y}\\) until \\(k\\)) as follows.\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\left\\lvert \\chi(k) \\right\\rvert \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left\\lvert \\sum_{t = 1}^k Y_t - \\frac{k}{n} \\sum_{t = 1}^n Y_t \\right\\rvert \\\\ \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left\\lvert \\sum_{t = 1}^k (Y_t - \\overline{Y}) \\right\\rvert \\end{aligned}$$\nwhere \\(\\overline{Y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t = 1}^n Y_t\\). In turn, we estimate \\(k\\) by maximizing the CUSUM.\n$$\\hat{k}^{CUSUM} = \\arg\\max_{1 \\le k \\le n} \\left\\lvert \\chi(k) \\right\\rvert$$\nIn fact, CUSUM inspect the absolute difference between \\(\\overline{Y}_k\\) and \\(\\overline{Y}_k^\\ast\\), i.e.\n$$\\lvert \\chi(k) \\rvert = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\frac{k (n - k)}{n} \\left\\lvert \\overline{Y}_k - \\overline{Y}_k^\\ast \\right\\rvert$$\nIt follows that CUSUM change point estimator is also an LSE estimator in that\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{k}^{LS} \u0026amp; = \\arg\\max_{1 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\sqrt{\\frac{k (n - k)}{n}} \\left\\lvert \\overline{Y}_k - \\overline{Y}_k^\\ast \\right\\rvert \\\\ \u0026amp; = \\arg\\max_{1 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k (n - k)}} \\left\\lvert \\chi(k) \\right\\rvert \\\\ \u0026amp; = \\arg\\max_{1 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\left\\lvert \\widetilde\\chi(k) \\right\\rvert \\end{aligned}$$\nwhere \\(\\left\\lvert \\widetilde\\chi(k) \\right\\rvert\\) is adjusted CUSUM defined by \\(\\left\\lvert \\widetilde\\chi(k) \\right\\rvert = \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k (n - k)}} \\lvert \\chi(k) \\rvert\\).\ncusum_output \u0026lt;- sim_single %\u0026gt;% mutate( ave = mean(value), cusum = abs(cumsum(value - ave)) / sqrt(n()) ) We can easily find the value which maximizes CUSUMüòÄ. See the trajectory of CUSUM figure. Its maximum stands out.\nThe second step is test. For this testing, we investigate some theory. As in the first Section, we test null hypothesis of no change point that \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\cdots = \\mu_n\\) versus single change point existence. Given each \\(\\hat{k}\\), we build test statistic and derive its (asymptotic) distribution. Under \\(H_0\\), functional central limit theorem holds under some conditions (see the tables below).
