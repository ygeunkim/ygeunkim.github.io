In the sample from 2005 to 2006, for example, the chosen model might forecast well. Imagine, however, we should include 2007 to 2008 period in which financial crisis occurred. The estimators of the model would change due to this event😭. It is important to figure out these change points because the model parameter could change at the point. The goal of change point analysis is to mark the timestamp when some parameter has changed. Here the simplest setting is to detect change of the mean \\(\\mu_t\\) in location model.\n$$Y_t = \\mu_t + \\epsilon_t, \\quad t = 1, \\ldots, n$$\nThen change point detection can be expressed by\n$$H_0: \\mu_1 = \\cdots = \\mu_n \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_1: \\exists k \\colon \\mu_1 = \\cdots = \\mu_k \\neq \\mu_{k + 1} = \\cdots = \\mu_n$$\nNow, each method should\n Estimate unknown \\(k\\).

To estimate \\(k\\), the most easiest way is to minimize sum of within sums of square.\nLet\n\\(\\overline{Y}_k = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{t = 1}^k Y_t\\) and let \\(\\overline{Y}_k^\\ast = \\frac{1}{n - k} \\sum_{t = k + 1}^n Y_t\\). Then\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{k}^{LS} \u0026amp; = \\arg\\min_{1 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\left( \\sum_{t = 1}^k (Y_t - \\overline{Y}_k)^2 + \\sum_{t = k + 1}^n (Y_t - \\overline{Y}_k^\\ast)^2 \\right) \\\\ \u0026amp; = \\arg\\max_{1 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\sqrt{\\frac{k (n - k)}{n}} \\left\\lvert \\overline{Y}_k - \\overline{Y}_k^\\ast \\right\\rvert \\end{aligned}$$\nObserve that by multiplying \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{k (n - k)}{n}}\\), it adjusts the location of \\(k\\) and the sample size. You can see this feature in the following figure.\nlse_output \u0026lt;- sim_single %\u0026gt;% mutate( mean_k = cumsum(value) / index, mean_ast = sapply( index + 1, function(i) { sum(value[i:n()]) } ) / (n() - index), lse_unadjust = abs(mean_k - mean_ast), lse_adjust = sqrt(index * (n() - index) / n()) * lse_unadjust )   While LSE estimator performs well, unadjusted LSE inflates against \\(k\\).\nCumulative Sum (CUSUM) Estimator This method is called CUSUM because it deals with cumulative sum (of \\(Y_t - \\overline{Y}\\) until \\(k\\)) as follows.\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\left\\lvert \\chi(k) \\right\\rvert \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left\\lvert \\sum_{t = 1}^k Y_t - \\frac{k}{n} \\sum_{t = 1}^n Y_t \\right\\rvert \\\\ \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left\\lvert \\sum_{t = 1}^k (Y_t - \\overline{Y}) \\right\\rvert \\end{aligned}$$\nwhere \\(\\overline{Y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t = 1}^n Y_t\\). In turn, we estimate \\(k\\) by maximizing the CUSUM.\n$$\\hat{k}^{CUSUM} = \\arg\\max_{1 \\le k \\le n} \\left\\lvert \\chi(k) \\right\\rvert$$\nIn fact, CUSUM inspect the absolute difference between \\(\\overline{Y}_k\\) and \\(\\overline{Y}_k^\\ast\\), i.e.\n$$\\lvert \\chi(k) \\rvert = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\frac{k (n - k)}{n} \\left\\lvert \\overline{Y}_k - \\overline{Y}_k^\\ast \\right\\rvert$$\nIt follows that CUSUM change point estimator is also an LSE estimator in that\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{k}^{LS} \u0026amp; = \\arg\\max_{1 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\sqrt{\\frac{k (n - k)}{n}} \\left\\lvert \\overline{Y}_k - \\overline{Y}_k^\\ast \\right\\rvert \\\\ \u0026amp; = \\arg\\max_{1 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k (n - k)}} \\left\\lvert \\chi(k) \\right\\rvert \\\\ \u0026amp; = \\arg\\max_{1 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\left\\lvert \\widetilde\\chi(k) \\right\\rvert \\end{aligned}$$\nwhere \\(\\left\\lvert \\widetilde\\chi(k) \\right\\rvert\\) is adjusted CUSUM defined by \\(\\left\\lvert \\widetilde\\chi(k) \\right\\rvert = \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k (n - k)}} \\lvert \\chi(k) \\rvert\\).\ncusum_output \u0026lt;- sim_single %\u0026gt;% mutate( ave = mean(value), cusum = abs(cumsum(value - ave)) / sqrt(n()) )  We can easily find the value which maximizes CUSUM😀. See the trajectory of CUSUM figure. Its maximum stands out.\n The second step is test. For this testing, we investigate some theory. As in the first Section, we test null hypothesis of no change point that \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\cdots = \\mu_n\\) versus single change point existence. Given each \\(\\hat{k}\\), we build test statistic and derive its (asymptotic) distribution. Under \\(H_0\\), functional central limit theorem holds under some conditions (see the tables below). Let \\(B(t)\\) is a Brownian bridge (standard Brownian motion) and let \\(\\sigma^2\\) be the long-run variance. The different part is scaling \\(\\sqrt{u (1 - u)}\\) for sample size. Multiplying unbalance against sample size raises precision of \\(\\hat{k}^{LS}\\), but it makes difficult to get p-value of \\(T_{LS}\\).\n    LSE CUSUM     Statistic $T_{LS} = \\max_{1 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\left\\lvert \\widetilde\\chi(k) \\right\\rvert$ $T_{CUSUM} = \\max_{1 \\le k \\le n} \\left\\lvert \\chi(k) \\right\\rvert$   Distribution $T_{LS} \\stackrel{\\cal{D}}{\\rightarrow} \\sigma \\sup_{0 \\le u \\le 1} \\frac{\\left\\lvert B(u) \\right\\rvert}{\\sqrt{u (1 - u)}}$ $T_{CUSUM} \\stackrel{\\cal{D}}{\\rightarrow} \\sigma \\sup_{0 \\le u \\le 1} \\left\\lvert B(u) \\right\\rvert$   p-value (computation) hard easy   $\\hat{k}$ precision good bias bad    Multiple Change Points Consider 3 change points: \\(k_1 = 100\\), \\(k_2 = 250\\), and \\(k_3 = 300\\).\ny1 \u0026lt;- tibble(key = \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, value = rnorm(100, mean = 0), mean = 0) y2 \u0026lt;- tibble(key = \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, value = rnorm(150, mean = 3), mean = 3) y3 \u0026lt;- tibble(key = \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, value = rnorm(50, mean = -1), mean = -1) y4 \u0026lt;- tibble(key = \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;, value = rnorm(50, mean = 1), mean = 1) # bind rows and bind time index column---------------- sim_multiple \u0026lt;- bind_rows(y1, y2, y3, y4) %\u0026gt;% mutate(index = 1:n())   In multiple change points problem, we do not know both location and the number of of \\(k\\)’s. In single change point problem, alternative hypothesis was literally the existence of one single point. Now, we should extend this hypothesis to at least one change point. Based on above CUSUM statistic detection, we introduce the following methods. Of course there are the other advanced detection methods, this post focus on simple approach in location model.\n Binary segmentation (Vostrikova 1981) Wild binary segmentation (Fryzlewicz 2014) MOSUM (Eichinger and Kirch 2018)  Binary Segmentation Binary segmentation suggested by Vostrikova (1981) is famous with its effective computation. This is basic algorithm, so it is also called standard binary segmentation (SBS). It performs single detection by top-down way. This helps computation cheap. Fryzlewicz (2014) provides well-organized pseudocode (section 3.2).1\nSBS cuts the entire sample \\(\\{ y_t \\mathpunct{:} t = 1, \\ldots n \\}\\) with change point. In turn, it explores each part thoroughly. In the algorithm, we can find CUSUM in single stick by means of detecting change point, respectively.\nfind_binseg \u0026lt;- function(data, s = 0, e) { cusum_out \u0026lt;- data %\u0026gt;% dplyr::filter(index \u0026gt; s, index \u0026lt;= e) %\u0026gt;% mutate( ave = mean(value), cusum = abs(cumsum(value - ave)) / sqrt(n()) ) %\u0026gt;% filter(cusum == max(cusum)) list( stat = cusum_out$cusum, change_point = cusum_out$index ) }  First, we find \\(k = 250\\):\n(binseg1 \u0026lt;- find_binseg(sim_multiple, 0, nrow(sim_multiple))) #\u0026gt; $stat #\u0026gt; [1] 7.13 #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; $change_point #\u0026gt; [1] 250  Next, see before and after \\(k = 250\\):\nfind_binseg(sim_multiple, 0, 250) #\u0026gt; $stat #\u0026gt; [1] 10.9 #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; $change_point #\u0026gt; [1] 99 find_binseg(sim_multiple, 251, nrow(sim_multiple)) #\u0026gt; $stat #\u0026gt; [1] 5.06 #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; $change_point #\u0026gt; [1] 300  Both statistics seems large, so we say these two points are change points.\nfind_binseg(sim_multiple, 0, 100) #\u0026gt; $stat #\u0026gt; [1] 0.506 #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; $change_point #\u0026gt; [1] 73 find_binseg(sim_multiple, 100, 250) #\u0026gt; $stat #\u0026gt; [1] 0.755 #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; $change_point #\u0026gt; [1] 209  Every statistic is small, so we stop here. Consider the last block, after 250. Following figure computes CUSUM in multiple change points setting. Recall that it is expected to be huge at the change point. In first two breaks, the estimators seem works okay. However, it does not at the last. Why?\n Observe their true mean from the simulation step:\n#\u0026gt; [1] 0 3 -1 1  We can expect that -1 and 1 were canceled. In the above figure, blue line is calculating CUSUM only in this area. The estimator looks like working better. In this example, binary segmentation could find 300 as change point since this block came at once after \\(k = 250\\) was found. SBS, however, is not guaranteed to include this specific local range since the process of detection is not predictable.\nFryzlewicz (2014) suggested randomly splitted localization as the solution. It is called Wild binary segmentation (WBS).\nWild Binary Segmentation Wild Binary Segmentation (WBS) is bootstrap version for binary segmentation. It chooses random interval \\([s_m, e_m]\\) ($m = 1, \\ldots M$) in each step. Moreover, the reason this technique is related to bootstrap is \\(s_m \u0026lt; e_m\\) are sampled with replacement. For instance:\nboot_size \u0026lt;- 10 # sampling with replacement-------------------- boot_eg \u0026lt;- matrix( sample(sim_multiple$index, size = boot_size * 2, replace = TRUE), nrow = 2, ncol = boot_size ) %\u0026gt;% apply(2, sort) # rownames------------------------------------- rownames(boot_eg) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;sm\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;em\u0026quot;) boot_eg #\u0026gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] #\u0026gt; sm 88 199 22 118 52 118 294 77 113 114 #\u0026gt; em 251 254 312 186 311 183 347 185 268 192  WBS also begins with the entire sequence as SBS does. However, it should get statistic maximum and change point for each bootstrap interval. Among them, the interval whose maxima is the largest.\nFryzlewicz (2014) provides algorithms of the wild binary segmentation (section 3.3). In this post, we follow the step as in previous section to help understand the whole procedure.\nFor the entire sequence (bootstrap size 100):\n# bootstrap---------------------------- boot1 \u0026lt;- matrix( sample(sim_multiple$index, size = 100 * 2, replace = TRUE), nrow = 2, ncol = 100 ) %\u0026gt;% apply(2, sort) # WBS---------------------------------- wbs1 \u0026lt;- boot1 %\u0026gt;% apply(2, function(x) {find_binseg(data = sim_multiple, s = x[1], e = x[2])})   Among 100 intervals, 250 gives the maximum CUSUM statistic. Next step, before 250:\n# bootstrap---------------------------- boot2 \u0026lt;- matrix( sample(1:250, size = 100 * 2, replace = TRUE), nrow = 2, ncol = 100 ) %\u0026gt;% apply(2, sort) # WBS---------------------------------- wbs2 \u0026lt;- boot2 %\u0026gt;% apply(2, function(x) {find_binseg(data = sim_multiple, s = x[1], e = x[2])})  After 250:\n# bootstrap---------------------------- boot3 \u0026lt;- matrix( sample(251:last(sim_multiple$index), size = 100 * 2, replace = TRUE), nrow = 2, ncol = 100 ) %\u0026gt;% apply(2, sort) # WBS---------------------------------- wbs3 \u0026lt;- boot3 %\u0026gt;% apply(2, function(x) {find_binseg(data = sim_multiple, s = x[1], e = x[2])})   Choose the point with the highest value in each color. Denote that they are similar to the true ones 👍🏼.\nMoving Sum (MOSUM) Statistic and Tests As we have seen above, localization of CUSUM can improve performance. MOSUM is localization of CUSUM statistic of window size \\(G\\) (Eichinger and Kirch 2018). In each window, moving sum is computed.\n$$\\left\\lvert T_{k, n}(G) \\right\\rvert = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 G}} \\left\\lvert \\sum_{t = k + 1}^{k + G} Y_t - \\sum_{t = k - G + 1}^k Y_t \\right\\rvert$$\nmosum_output \u0026lt;- sim_multiple %\u0026gt;% mutate( roll_mean = rollsum(value, k = 20, na.pad = TRUE, align = \u0026quot;right\u0026quot;), mosum = abs(lead(roll_mean, n = 20) - roll_mean) / sqrt(2 * 20) )  Unlike CUSUM, MOSUM is detecting the last change point by localization.\n The next step is similar to CUSUM or the other statistic.\n$$T_n(G) = \\max_{G \\le k \\le n - G} \\frac{\\left\\lvert T_{k, n}(G) \\right\\rvert}{\\sigma}$$\nwith long-run variance \\(\\sigma\\). Now we can see additional topics to solve:\n Estimate long-run variance and choose the bandwidth.  Let \\(q = q_n\\) be the number of changes and let \\(k_1 \u0026lt; k_2 \u0026lt; \\cdots \u0026lt; k_q\\) be each change point. Then the null hypothesis of no change point can be represented by\n$$H_0: q_n = 0$$\nversus alternative hypothesis of at least one change\n$$H_1: q_n \\ge 1$$\nRecall that CUSUM converges in distribution to Brownian bridge. This enables the computation of p-value. Also in MOSUM framework, some asymptotic theorem holds. Under above null hypothesis, \\(T_n(G)\\) can use the distribution Gumbel extreme value distribution asymptotically. The form is quite complex, so we skip the details in this post. Please see Theorem 2.1 of Eichinger and Kirch (2018) 😱.\nVariance Now, we estimate long-run variance in each break instead of sample variance \\(\\hat\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n - 1}\\sum_{t = 1}^n (Y_t - \\overline{Y})^2\\). Assuming i.i.d. errors, implementing the sample variance formula is suggested. Let \\(\\overline{Y}_{k - G + 1, k} = \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{t = k - G + 1}^k Y_t\\) be the sample mean of \\(G\\) points before \\(k\\) and let \\(\\overline{Y}_{k + 1, k + G} = \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{t = k + 1}^{k + G} Y_t\\) be the sample mean of \\(G\\) points after \\(k\\). Eichinger and Kirch (2018) computed sample variance in this window of \\(k\\)-th point:\n$$\\hat\\sigma_{k, n}^2 = \\frac{1}{2G} \\left( \\sum_{t = k - G + 1}^k (Y_t - \\overline{Y}_{k - G + 1, k})^2 + \\sum_{t = k + 1}^{k + G} (Y_t - \\overline{Y}_{k + 1, k + G})^2 \\right)$$\nmosum_var \u0026lt;- sim_multiple %\u0026gt;% mutate( roll_mean = rollsum(value, k = 20, na.pad = TRUE, align = \u0026quot;right\u0026quot;), mosum = abs(lead(roll_mean, n = 20) - roll_mean) / sqrt(2 * 20), roll_var = (rollapply(value, width = 20, var, fill = NA, align = \u0026quot;right\u0026quot;) * 19 + rollapply(value, width = 20, var, fill = NA, align = \u0026quot;left\u0026quot;) * 19) / 40, mosum_est = mosum / sqrt(roll_var) )  The following shows MOSUM statistic \\(\\hat\\sigma_{k, n}^{-1} \\left\\lvert T_{k, n}(G) \\right\\rvert\\). By multiplying standard deviation to the sum, now we can detect change point more clearly.\n Bandwidth Selection Try \\(G = 5, 10, 20, 40, 45\\). One of many assumptions in the paper of Eichinger and Kirch (2018) is that the window size \\(2G\\) should be large enough (Assumption A.2). The figure below is MOSUM statistic for each bandwidth. When \\(G = 3, 5\\), i.e. the bandwidth is small, you can see it is not easy to find maximum of the statistic. In large bandwidth, the maximum points stand out.\n Wrapping up We have covered change point analysis for univariate time series. Codes I have written are absolutely not practical. In fact, many researchers already developed useful packages for this topic. Later, I plan to write a post about detecting change point using R (of course, using CRAN packages 🤗).\n References Baek, Changryong. 2020. “Recent Advances in Applied Statistics (Sta5037).” Department of Statistics, Sungkyunkwan University; https://sites.google.com/view/crbaek.\n Eichinger, Birte, and Claudia Kirch. 2018. “A MOSUM procedure for the estimation of multiple random change points.” Bernoulli 24 (1): 526–64. https://doi.org/10.3150/16-bej887.\n Fryzlewicz, Piotr. 2014. “Wild binary segmentation for multiple change-point detection.” The Annals of Statistics 42 (6): 2243–81. https://doi.org/10.1214/14-aos1245.\n PAGE, E.
