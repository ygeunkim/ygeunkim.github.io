    "text": "Residual Size is Not Enough for Anomaly Detection: Improving Detection Performance using Residual Similarity in Multivariate Time Series\n\n\nUnsupervised anomaly detection is commonly performed by identifying unusual data samples (or anomalies) from the residual size produced by machine learning algorithms based on normal data (e.g., the residuals of regression models or reconstruction errors of autoencoder models), assuming that anomalies cause large residuals. Unfortunately, anomalies do not always cause large residu- als. Anomaly detection algorithms based on residual size can miss anomalies that cause only small or noisy residuals for each variable in a multivariate time-series. To overcome this issue, we propose “neighbors to residuals” (N2RE), a novel anomaly scoring function based on residual similarity using nearest neighbor distance (NND). Even if residuals of anomalies are small, they show patterns that are different from those of residuals of normal data. Using N2RE can improve anomaly detection performance and reduce the variation in anomaly detection performance due to threshold changes. Experiments with various models on three cyber-physical system datasets verify that N2RE can achieve 19% higher anomaly detection performance than previous approaches without changes to the models.\n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\nJeong-Han Yun, Jonguk Kim, Won-Seok Hwang, Young Geun Kim, Simon S.

It is especially difficult to accurately model various instances of CPS measurements due to the dearth of anomaly samples and the subtlety of how their patterns appear. Moreover, the detection performance may be severely limited owing to mediocre or inaccurate forecasting by the underlying prediction models. In this work, we focus on improving the anomaly detection performance by leveraging the forecasting error patterns generated from prediction models, such as Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq), Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). To this end, we introduce Self-Organizing Map-based Anomaly Detector (SOMAD), an anomaly detection framework based on a novel test statistic, SomAnomaly, for Cyber-Physical System (CPS) security. Upon evaluation on two popular CPS datasets, we demonstrate that SOMAD outperforms baseline approaches through online multiple testing, using Time-Series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) metrics. Accordingly, we empirically demonstrate that forecasting error patterns of raw CPS data can be useful when detecting anomalies through a fast, statistical multiple testing approach such as ours.\n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nYoung Geun Kim, Jeong-Han Yun, Siho Han, Hyoung Chun Kim, Simon S.

    "text": "Contextual Anomaly Detection by Correlated Probability Distributions using Kullback-Leibler Divergence\n\n\nWe investigate anomaly detection in Cyber-Physical System (CPS), where often anomalies are attacks to CPS to disrupt the operations of critical infrastructures. We use secure water treatment (SWaT) systems dataset, where normal and attack states are simulated at the water tanks. Among different types of anomalies, we focus on detecting contextual anomaly, which can be difficult to detect from Out-Of-Limit threshold method. Recent research shows the promising result in detecting anomalies from analyzing error distributions from the machine learning classifier. In a similar way, we statistically analyze prediction error patterns from RNN and MDN classifiers to detect anomalies. First, we generate anomaly scores with Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and remove point anomalies. With the fixed window size, empirical probability distribution is estimated, and we apply the sliding window to measure the difference of probability distributions between the other windows. To measure the difference efficiently between anomalies and normal data, we use Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our preliminary result shows that we can effectively detect contextual anomalies compared with Nearest Neighbor Distance (NND) approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\nJinwoo Cho, Shahroz Tariq, Sangyup Lee, Young Geun Kim, Jeong-Han Yun, Jonguk Kim, Hyoung Chun Kim, Simon S.

    "text": "Bayesian Vector Heterogeneous Autoregressive Modeling\n\n\nThe Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model with the Minnesota prior proposed by Litterman [Litterman RB. Forecasting with bayesian vector autoregressions-five years of experience. J Business Economic Statist.1986;4(1):25–38.] has been very successful in multivariate time series modelling, providing better forecasting performance. However, the conventional Minnesota prior for BVAR depends only on the latest lag; in turn, it is not suitable for multivariate long memory time series forecasting. This study extends BVAR to (possibly) high-dimensional long memory time series. To this end, we incorporate a vector heterogeneous autoregressive (VHAR) structure to accommodate long-term persistence and impose priors on distant lags as well. Our proposed Bayesian VHAR (BVHAR) models, the so-called BVHAR-S and BVHAR-L, are easy to implement by using the Normal-inverse-Wishart prior and added dummy variable approach of [Bańbura M, Giannone D, Reichlin L. Large bayesian vector auto regressions. J Appl Econom. 2010;25(1):71–92.]. A supporting simulation study also proves posterior consistency. We further apply our models to nine CBOE Volatility Indices (VIXs) and show that our BVHAR models perform best in forecasting with the narrowest forecasting region.\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nYoung Geun Kim, Changryong Baek\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
